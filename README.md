Conway's Game Of Life - React

This is Shawn's versions of Conway's Game of Life. There is no intent to change the general concept, rather only to create my own visualization of the game.

The Cellular Automata is a mathematical logical construct that is used widely still today. The uses and purposes vary, but it is widely used in many fields, such as physical and biological systems, cryptography, and the creation of multimedia content.

The project went well. If I had more time, I'd like to implement changing the grid size, and add more to the design. I'd also like to add a landing page with rules, and more design displays.
